diabetes|Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by high blood sugar levels, resulting from inadequate insulin production or impaired insulin function. Insulin, produced by the pancreas, regulates the absorption and utilization of glucose in the body. In type 1 diabetes, the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, while in type 2 diabetes, the body becomes resistant to insulin or doesn't produce enough of it. Diabetes can lead to various complications affecting the eyes, kidneys, nerves, and cardiovascular system. It requires lifelong management, including blood sugar monitoring, healthy eating, regular physical activity, and, in some cases, medication or insulin therapy under the guidance of healthcare professionals.|0|20|0|60|0|5|0|10|0
